# Quant Factor Library

## Overview
Quant Factor Library is an open-source modular framework for researching and backtesting financial factors. It is aimed at contributors with intermediate programming and finance knowledge.

## Features
- Implement common factors such as momentum, value, and size.
- Run backtests and analyze factor performance.
- Add new factors or strategies.
- Document and share results with the community.

## Roadmap
1. Implement starter factors with example datasets.
2. Create modular backtesting scripts.
3. Build reporting templates for factor performance.
4. Encourage community contributions and reviews.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
3. Add new factors, improve backtesting scripts, or enhance documentation.

## Vision
Create a community-maintained library for factor research that students and aspiring quants can use and extend.
